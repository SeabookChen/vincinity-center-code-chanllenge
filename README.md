# What I have been achieved
- Add dark mode switching functionality to the _existing_ #mode button ✅
  - Utilise the _existing_ css file by adding a `dark` class to the root `html` element ✅
- Add large mode switching functionality to the _existing_ #layout button ✅
  - Utilise the _existing_ css file by adding a `large` class to the root `html` element ✅
- Fetch and display _posts_ and _todos_ of user _1_ ✅
  - API docs https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/ ✅
- Feel free to make any additional improvements that showcase your strengths.
  - Use `data-colortheme` and `data-layouttheme` for better html markup context ✅
  - Add `User Info` for more completed chanllenge ✅
  - Implemented router params, user can input `/feed/:userId` to get specific user posts and todos ✅
  - Seperate the components and services into different folders ✅
  - Tried my best to apply Typescript types


# Think about
- How we would use Dark mode on other potential routes/components in a bigger application. Would your solution work for this?
Probably not, complex components may require customized Dark mode, so a good way is to use a global state / redux and apply the state to each component.

- How we can apply a class to the `html` DOM element
I used the dom manipulation probably is not the best solution.

- Do you resolve each API request one after the other or in parallel?
I used Promise.all(), which will fire off the requests simultaneously

- Where do you make the API requests?
I extracted to a API.ts file under `services` folder

- How much logic do you offload out of the UI components?
I tried my best to offload all the api calls to the `services` folder

# Vicinity Frontend Coding Challenge

Welcome to the Vicinity Frontend coding challenge.

&nbsp;

# Initial project specifications

- Create an app that has the following pages
  - Home
  - Feed
- Provide theme changing functionality
  - Dark and Light mode
  - Standard and Large layout for the visually impaired

# Goals/Outcomes

- Project architecture and component restructuring
- Using state and global state - don't install any new packages for this
- DOM manipulation
- Consuming APIs and handling responses
- Loading state and knowing where and how to make multiple API calls efficiently
